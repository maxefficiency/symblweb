## Update 3
- Fixed comment field resizing. Now set to none
- Form margins and padding visually improved, including the dropdown menu (leftoff gaps removed)
- Form textarea and inputs transitions on click added
- Fixed weird scroll behavior. Added custom centralised js functions to switch scroll on / off after interactions with the modal.
Details: the scroll was blocked after form completion, error, outside click (only worked after pressing x); also general page scroll appeared with the comment field and the loading circle; fixed all those as well.

### To consider
- Popup with a leadmagnet
- CRM integration
