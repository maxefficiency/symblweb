## Update 2
- Replaced browser alerts with custom notifications
- Added properly working comment field for 'Other' option
- Styles tweaks (removed markers in options, synchronized font sizes)
- Torus mobile adaptivity

### To update
- Comment field resizing

## Update 3
- Fixed comment field resizing. Now set to none
- Form margins and padding visually improved, including the dropdown menu (leftoff gaps removed)
- Form textarea and inputs transitions on click added
- Fixed weird scroll behavior. Added custom centralised js functions to switch scroll on / off after interactions with the modal.
Details: the scroll was blocked after form completion, error, outside click (only worked after pressing x); also general page scroll appeared with the comment field and the loading circle; fixed all those as well.

### To consider
- Popup with a leadmagnet
- CRM integration

18.07.2025
## Update 4
- Added robots.txt
- Added Meta tags for SEO (name, description, keywords), Social networks (og:name, og:description, og:image*)
- Added sitemap.xml
- Added Google Analytics (and Google tag)

  
- Added SSL certificate (on ispmanager)
- Also set some redirects and caching

- Compressed images for better loading

  **Design-wise**
- Prototype of eyes animation for features section (prototypes directory)
- Slightly moved the donut in Hero
- Rewrote filler texts in particular sections (Portfolio, Features). Instead of gaming-industry placeholder there are now proper fashion ones.

### To consider and to update
*og:image needs to be created in the nearest future
- Potentially: add hero-donut overflow. It's a bit confusing (ran into a bug due to specific cursor interaction). Will have to dive deeper in case implementation needed.
- Surfed SpeedInsights for optimisation cues. Decided not to invest time into scripts and styles optimisation as it's a one-page site. But worth future consideration!
- Might have forgot some info so README will be edited with a 'P.S' (if not, then everything was noted correctly)
